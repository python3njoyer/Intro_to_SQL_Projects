I wrote this script as part of a group project, the objective being to design a relational database based off a real company. This design was inspired by the Barnes & Noble online store and attempts to incorporate several elements from it. Some features of the database include:
- Books available for purchase in three different formats: print, digital, and audiobook
- Registered users with a computer-generated name, email, and security question and answer (see Data_generator repository)
- Publisher and author tables with associated products
- Orders and invoices
- Aggregate functions to calculate order totals
- Ratings and tags that readers can leave on books they have purchased
- A "product profile" with aggregate function to display the average rating of products
